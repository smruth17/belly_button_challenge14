# belly_button_challenge14
Module 14
In this assignment, I used VS code with HTML and Javascript starter code to create a webpage dashboard based off of the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. I used javascript, d3, plotly, and bootstrap (with bootswatch) to create an interactive horizontal bar chart, bubble chart, and metadata panel witha link to the actual study.
